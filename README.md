## Custom Server App
### Introduction
This my server app that I use to learn HTML, JavaScript, CSS, React and more.

You can get to the site [here](https://test-fly-io-dansan-holy-grass-1585.fly.dev).
It might take some time before you get in for the machine to get running.

### Tools
This is a site from **fly.io**. If you provide them with a React repository they will set up docker for you.
Recommended to install flyctl and fly for terminal use since commandline seems to have the most support. There you can launch the app repository and then deploy it.
